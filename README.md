<h1>Bill splitting app</h1>
  This project was carried out with the purpose of learning React Native.
  I felt the best way to learn React Native/React.JS was to dive straight in. Upon viewing the documentation, I thought of a simple idea as a basis to start learning, this was it, a utility bill splitter...exciting, I know!

  
  <h2>Learning objectives</h2>
  
  + Components and props
  + JSX
  + State management
  + React Native Core components
  
  <h2>Functionality</h2>
  
  + The user can insert the names of everyone that is partly responsible for the bills.
  + The user can either split based on usage (presence in the house during the bill period) or outright evenly.
    + If based on usage, then the user can insert the number of days each housemate was present during that period. 
  + The user can pick what type of bill it is: water, gas/electric, or broadband.
  + The user can view the split breakdown and how each total was calculated.
