# Bill splitting app

This project was carried out with the purpose of learning React Native.
I felt the best way to learn React Native/React.JS was to dive straight in. Upon viewing the documentation, I thought of a simple idea as a basis to start learning, this was it, a utility bill splitter...exciting, I know!

## Learning objectives ✔️

+ Components and props
+ JSX
+ State management
+ React Native Core components

## Functionality 🔋

+ The user can insert the names of everyone that is partly responsible for the bills.
+ The user can either split based on usage (presence in the house during the bill period) or outright evenly.
  + If based on usage, then the user can insert the number of days each housemate was present during that period. 
+ The user can pick what type of bill it is: water, gas/electric, or broadband.
+ The user can view the split breakdown and how each total was calculated.
